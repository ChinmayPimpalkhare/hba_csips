# Hierarchical Continuous Bandit Algorithms for Convex Semi-Infinite Programs

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to implementing **Hierarchical Continuous Bandit Algorithms** from the X-armed bandit literature, aimed at solving a class of optimization problems known as **Convex Semi-Infinite Programs (CSIP)**. 

The project builds upon the existing [PyXAB](https://github.com/your-link-to-PyXAB-repo) library, extending it with custom classes, modifications, and strategies that cater specifically to CSIP. The focus is on developing scalable, efficient, and robust solutions using these algorithms while documenting comprehensive experimental results.

### Folders:
- **src/**: Contains the core implementations. This is where you will find and implement modifications to existing algorithms, new partitioning strategies, and objective functions for your custom problem classes.
    - `algorithms/`: Custom modifications to PyXAB's algorithms.
    - `partitioning/`: Partitioning strategies for the X-armed bandit problem.
    - `objectives/`: Classes for testing the algorithm's performance on different objective functions.

- **tests/**: Contains unit and integration tests for the project. Each major component (algorithms, partitioning, objectives) has its own test file. Testing is a critical part of this project as we need to verify that our modifications work across a range of problems.

- **docs/**: Documentation files, including detailed explanations of the algorithms, partitioning strategies, and CSIP problem setup.

- **results/**: Contains results from testing and experimentation. Tables and images generated during testing will be stored here for analysis and comparison.

## Installation

To get started with the project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Optional)

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Dependencies

- `PyXAB`: The base library for implementing X-armed bandit algorithms.
- `pytest`: For running tests.
- `numpy`, `matplotlib`: Used for handling numerical computations and visualizing results.

## Usage

This repository is designed for both algorithm development and testing. You can run the algorithms with various problem instances, objective functions, and partitioning strategies by modifying the scripts in the `src/` directory. 

### Running the Algorithms
To run your custom implementations:

1. Navigate to the `src/` directory.
2. Modify or create a script that uses the custom algorithm classes, partitioning strategies, or objective functions.
3. Execute the Python file.

Example:
```bash
python src/algorithms/run_algorithm.py
```

### Running Tests
To ensure everything is working correctly, run the tests using `pytest`:

```bash
pytest tests/
```

This will execute all unit and integration tests to verify the integrity of your code.

## Features

This project extends the PyXAB library in several key ways:

1. **Custom Algorithm Modifications**:
    - Implements hierarchical and continuous bandit algorithms tailored for CSIP problems.
    - Optimizes the exploration-exploitation trade-off for convex semi-infinite problems.

2. **Partitioning Strategies**:
    - Introduces new strategies to divide the continuous action space efficiently.
    - Ensures better exploration of the space for optimization.

3. **Objective Functions**:
    - A variety of convex and non-convex objective functions for algorithm performance testing.
    - Includes both synthetic and real-world problem instances.

## Testing

We take a test-driven approach to development, and all custom classes are rigorously tested. Test files are located in the `tests/` folder, with separate test scripts for algorithms, partitioning, and objective functions.

To run all tests:
```bash
pytest
```

## Results

Experiment results, such as performance tables, execution times, and visualizations, will be saved in the `results/` folder. This folder contains:
- **tables/**: Stores result tables in `.csv` or `.txt` format.
- **images/**: Stores visualizations and performance plots as `.png` or `.pdf`.

Detailed analysis and results will be documented here after each major experimental run.
